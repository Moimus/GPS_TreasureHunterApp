# TreasureHunterApp
SEITE 3Long story short, the goal of the project is the development of a multi-platform app, which gives the user the opportunity to go on a mixed reality treasure hunt wherever he/she might be.</br>
While searching for treasures the user will encounter different objects to interact with and will be ultimately rewarded with ingame-currency for completing a treasure hunt called „Quest“.</br>
Furthermore the project is meant to be a proof of concept for the author and basic groundwork for developing more complicated GPS apps.</br>
